<meta name="description" content="&quot;In this presentation, we'll take a journey through the evolution of generative models, toward the most recent techniques based on estimating a velocity field in the data space.\n\nWe'll delve into the details of Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), exploring its mechanics and gaining insights into its core principles. We'll also examine how CFM is linked to Optimal Transport (OT) and what can be gained from these links. The relative simplicity of CFM will finally lead us to a critical question in generative models: what does it take for generative models to generalize effectively?\n\nIf you cannot attend the presentation or want to read more about CFM, see &lt;https://dl.heeere.com/cfm/&gt;\n&quot;">
