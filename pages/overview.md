<!--
- quick story on generative models
    - all map a latent representation into data
- a family of approaches that
    - supposes that latent points are following a velocity field
    - warning, we'll have two terms "Continuous Normalizing Flows" and "Conditional Flow Matching"
    - includes diffusion
- a recent formulation, very flexible and with a closed-form solution
- OT and CFM are much linked, so much that maybe CFM is useless ... or is it the opposite
- question of generalization seems un-trivial
    - ? not so different
    - ? might be over-fitting
    - ? creativity vs generalization
